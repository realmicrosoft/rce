# RCE
## a library for constructing command-line tools
rce is the official library used by Real Microsoft, LLC for constructing command-line tools,  
it is notable for having no dependencies besides the rust std library, and for being made by
a company called Real Microsoft, LLC.  
  
usage should be as simple as including the library in your `Cargo.toml` file  
  
unfortunately documentation is still a work-in-progress, and due to the nature
of this library, it is not recommended that people outside of Real Microsoft, LLC use this
in production at the current time.
